# Task Planner
## Overview
This is a multi user task planner which lets users Create, Read, Update, Delete and assign tasks to other users.

- Users need to be registered and logged in before being able to create a task. <br>
- When a user creates a task (active user) he gains ownership over said task. <br>
- Active users can add a title, description, due date, assign users and edit or delete the task. <br>
- Users assigned to the task (passive users) are the only ones that can report the task as completed. <br>
- The owner of the task gets notified when the task is completed. <br>
